Tools


Need a tool that can locate objects on their metadata and generate 
packages for them.   This isn't the most efficient way to do this.  
However, for the sake of initial package building it will be fine.  This 
does not need to be fast.  Later virtual packages can build from 
these base packages and would be subsets of them or combinations of 
subsets of many.
